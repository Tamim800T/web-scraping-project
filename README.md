# web-scraping-project
A Python-based web scraper that collects and organizes job listings by title, company, location, salary, and skills.

This project was developed as part of my Coursera course on web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup.

The script scrapes remote job listings from a given job site and collects data on:

- Job Title

All scraped data is saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

| `remote_jobs.csv`   | Raw output from the scraping script        |

Skills Applied:
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
